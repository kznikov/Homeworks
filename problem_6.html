						<h1>CONTENT: notes on this 3col Fixed assignment</h1>
						<p>As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is detectible wherethe div meets
							the .jpg background. I used the same hexidecimal number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?</p>
						<p>This exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one fixed strip. I get serious Float Drop
							when I resize (reduce) the browser window. I think tht is what "display:inline;/* stops IE doubling margin
							on float" is for, but would like further explaination to understand this comment.</p>
						<p>Is keeping the #wrapper div necessary in a stylesheet if there is also going to be 
							seperate version wrappers as we have here to contain the different background images? Or perhaps this is an example
							of an inner div as the book suggests? I am still confused on that detail.</p>
						<p>Even though I have auto margin sets on the wrapper div, the page still huggs the left side
							? I've tried it in all of them, but it won't budge?</p>
						<p>Obviously, this footer has a mind of it's own...it's in the wrapper, but the "clear" seems
							to be allowing it outside. However, when I remove the clear, it hugs the bottom of the header?</p>
